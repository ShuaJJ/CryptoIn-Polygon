### CryptoIn is fully decentralized! No central servers are used!

Although currently Twitter is still the main social platform for crypto people, it’s still a web2 platform and crypto is just a small part of it. Second of all, without identity verification, there are lots of scammers pretending they are crypto professionals. So sometimes, people can connect with wrong person. There are not many decentralized features and technologies involved as well. Last but not least, nowadays in crypto, how can we miss earnings while using the app?

Also we don’t have an authenticated platform like LinkedIn in web3 where users can connect professionals or find a job. There are some job listing app in web3, however, talents in crypto such as web3 developers, they seem not likely to apply for a job through this kind of site with a resume. In web3, projects tend to hire the people they know or connected via friends. This is actually difficult in most of the time. If we can do this through a dapp, things would be faster and easier.

Here comes CryptoIn, a web3 professional social platform built with decentralized technologies!
